    "The movies watched by user `569` fall under a mixed bag of genres.  There are movies from Drama, Crime, Thriller to Children category. Most of the recommendations are movies from franchise like Jurrasic World, Die Hard and Batman. It is obvious to get franchise recommendations due to high similarity scores between their contents. But often times sequels of movies are not as popular as the original ones, and the algorithm does not consider popularity. Overall, the recommender has filtered movies that fall under sci-fi, action, crime and thriller. But the algorithm has not caught comedy or romance. In short, the recommendations are less diverse. "

    "This recommendation engine focuses on content of the movies. It considers features like genre, movie synopsis, tagline, keywords, director and cast; and determines the similarity between movies based on these features. This recommender does not need any data from other users and hence can be easily scaled to large number of users. This is mainly bacause the item data (movies) does not grow as rapidly as user data. It is also helpful in recommending niche/less popular items specific to the user's interest. This recommender also solves the problem of cold start for new users, as it is not affected by inadequate ratings data. \n",

    "While this model has its advantages, it also suffers from a fair share of disadvantages. It relies predominantly on domain knowledge as most of the features are engineered manually. Therefore the model can only be as good as its features. Additionally, it makes recommendations based on the user's existing interests. It is therefore less diverse in regards to recommending new items. It has a limited ability towards expansion. Another disadvantage of this model is that it does not consider the popularity of the recommendations. "
